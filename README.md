# Repository for code from Summer 2019 REU project on Dual Quasars

HMQ_with_mag is (?) the list of MAST cross-matched HMQ targets

SDSS_with_mag_and_z is (?) the list of MAST cross-matched SDSS targets

available_volume.py is the available volume calculation code

calculatingETCParameters.py is the code to calculate the parameters needed to calculate the limiting magnitude

dataRetrieve_makeCountours.py is the code to pull data from HST and produce contour plots from it


Contour creation code is now housed in a much nicer setup <a href="https://github.com/lcgordon/hubble_contours"> here</a>
